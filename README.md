Coconut_v1
==========

Coconut APRS tracker project  
This is based on Thomas Krahn's PecanPico project (https://github.com/tkrahn). While the PecanPico is intended to be a very lightweight low-power tracker for long duration high altitude balloon launches, the Coconut is its bigger cousin intended for full-time mobile use in a car or other vehicle.  
This repository will contain the software and hardware (gerber) files for reproducing this open source, open hardware project.
